# Next.js 15 Unhandled Runtime Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon runtime error encountered in Next.js 15 when utilizing experimental features. The issue revolves around an unclear error message, making debugging challenging.

## Problem

The original `pages/index.js` file uses a simplified structure.  Upon running the application, an unhandled runtime error occurs, without providing much context to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Solution

The solution involves updating the Next.js configuration to correctly handle the experimental features.  This might involve updating the `next.config.js` file or adjusting the way the experimental features are implemented.
